In this page, we lists work describing majority-logic synthesis algorithms and
techniques.

Majority-logic synthesis
------------------------

(Horna, 1963) :cite:`Horna63`

This note describes a simple example in which the synthesis method by Akers
misses the minimum solution for a majority-3 function.  It mentions that the
Miiller-Winder method can find the optimum.
