Decomposition
=============

In this page, we lists work describing decomposition techniques using majority
functions.

Majority gate networks
----------------------

(Amarel, Cooke, Winder, 1964) :cite:`ACW64`

The paper discusses the decomposition of simple threshold functions (i.e., all
weights are 1) by means of majority-:math:`n` gates.  It also discusses the
special case of decompositions of majority-:math:`n` in terms of smaller
majority gates.  In their paper they restate the problem *How can the 5-argument
majority function be realized with a network of 3-input majority gates?*
initially proposed by D.A. Huffman.  They conjectured that the best way to
represent the majority-7 function is by using 9 majority-3 gates, which was
later improved and is now known to be 7 majority-7 gates.

The minimization of schemes on a majority basis
-----------------------------------------------

(Rozenblyum, 1968) :cite:`Rozenblyum68`

The paper discusses majority decomposition identities for monotone and arbitrary
Boolean function.  It derives identities, which can act as rewriting rules and
allow to express a given majority decomposition in terms of another one by
simple Boolean transformations.
