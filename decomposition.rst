functions.

The paper discusses the decomposition of simple threshold functions (i.e., all
weights are 1) by means of majority-:math:`n` gates.  It also discusses the
special case of decompositions of majority-:math:`n` in terms of smaller
majority gates.  In their paper they restate the problem `How can the 5-argument
majority function be realized with a network of 3-input majority gates?`
initially proposed by D.A. Huffman.  They conjectured that the best way to
represent the majority-7 function is by using 9 majority-3 gates, which was
later improved and is now known to be 7 majority-7 gates.
